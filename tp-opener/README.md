# Usage

Login into the webinterface and copy the token out of your Cookie afterwards. Use the token to run the command line tool:

cargo run -- TOKEN_HERE
```

## Notes

- you need to run it once with a working internet connection to download the dependencies
- if your token starts with a dash, you need to escape it with an extra " -- "
